# GA Tenders Export Review

After inspecting the assets under `public/ga-tenders`, the Vite/React project scaffold is present (entry HTML, `App.tsx`, `index.tsx`, TypeScript config, and package manifest). However, the exported bundle is incomplete compared to what the `App.tsx` file expects.

## Missing source folders
- `App.tsx` imports UI modules from `./components`, hooks from `./hooks`, and a Gemini service from `./services`, but none of these directories (or any of the referenced files such as `components/Sidebar.tsx` or `services/geminiService.ts`) are included in the repository export.
- Because these modules are absent, the project cannot compile or run; TypeScript will fail to resolve the imported symbols.

## Suggested follow-up
- Re-export (or manually copy) the `components`, `hooks`, `services`, and any other directories/files referenced by `App.tsx` from Google AI Studio so they live alongside `App.tsx`.
- After adding the missing files, run `npm install` (or `bun install`) inside `public/ga-tenders` and `npm run dev` to verify the interface renders as expected.

Once those missing files are added, the project should more accurately mirror the 1:1 UI you built in Google AI Studio.
